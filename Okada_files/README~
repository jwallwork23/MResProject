MeshFiles contains the triangle and .msh format of the mesh used in David Williams Msci
and should work.

fault.txt - parameters for solver (discretisation of domain)
okada_b2.txt - parameters for the fault (dip etc) (sorry for confusing names)
             - b2 refers to Lisbon b2 scenario of Horsburgh et al. 2008

okada_b2_av_full.nc - netCDF covering whole domain with surface deformation.

Okada_b2av.py - solves surface deformation for a fault model as specified in text files
STATIC - will need a netCDF output.
DYNAMIC - fine as it is.
OkadaVelocity_b2av.py - solves surface deformation for a time-dependent fault model

LisbonTsunami_b2av_Dyn.flml - solves the Dynamic Case (normal flow boundary condition at bottom) with output of OkadaVelocity_b2av.py
LisbonTsunami_b2av_Static.flml - solves the Static Case (free surface perturbation at t=0) from netCDF file supplied

GFD_basisChange_tools.py - written by Alex Avdis - do not need to touch.
                         - changes coordinate systems.
